# Poison and sickness checks
You can apply all poisons and diseases directly from the compendiums:
1. mark the token as target
2. open the library
3. pick out the poison or disease you want to use under *equipment* -> *poison* or *disease*
4. open it with a click and in the window's top right, click the dice *Roll effect*.
5. in the window of the poison test you can see if you have marked the target correctly by the toughness/soul power. A click on *roll* executes the check.

You will find the result in the chat window.  
**Note: The effect must still be applied manually.
