**Attention: works only with System Version 2.0.0 and Foundry Version 0.8.6 or higher.  
In addition, these effects are only registered in the modules available for purchase with the spells/liturgies.  
  
Many spells/liturgies have been given effects that you can apply directly to the target if the spell succeeds. This works both in and out of combat.  
1. mark token as target (double right click or use left menu)  
2. roll the spell, and if it succeeds  
3.1 Apply effect to self or  
3.2 Apply effect to target

You will see a symbol next to the token of the target which symbolizes the effect (1). You will also find the effect in the status bar of the character sheet (2).
