Wiki Repository for the Foundry VTT TDE/DSA5 System

This is the source repository for the wiki for the Foundry VTT system [Das Schwarze Auge / The Dark Eye 5](https://github.com/Plushtoast/dsa5-foundryVTT).
The contents will be pushed periodically to the system's github page.

Documentation is a lot of work and can never be enough. So if you feel like there is something missing, please help us out and fill the gaps.

Useful content besides system explanations for the wiki could be:

* Tricks for adventures
* Recommendations for addons
* Best practices
* Pointers to content
