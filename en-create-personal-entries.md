# Create your own content
Based on the templates from the DSA5 system and the rulebooks you can create many things yourself.  
You are missing a spell from the AM II? Do you need a consecrated from the AG I? No problem create the content yourself.  

## Import a template from the compendiums
The easiest way is to [import](en-library.md#use-contents) a template from one of the compendiums.
Then you look at how this template is written and adapt it to your wishes.

### Example: Ritual Adamantium from AM II
This method has the advantage that you can reuse the content you have created or even import it into your own compendium.
1. import any ritual from the compendium *Spells, Rituals, and Cantrips  
  
![Ritual Arcanovi](images/en-create-personal-entries_0.webp)  
  
2. rewrite the description and the details of the values of the new ritual
  
![Ritual Adamantium](images/en-create-personal-entries_1.webp)
  
3. dragging the ritual to the hero's character sheet

## Change entry in the character
If you want to recreate the new content for only one character, then drag the matching counterpart onto the character and change the description and details there. However, this does not work with species, culture and profession. These are applied directly to the character and must be imported.
