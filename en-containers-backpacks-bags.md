# Bags 
**Note: this only works with system version 2.0.0 and Foundry 0.8.6 or higher**.

You can now use items as bags and put other items in them.  
You can then easily equip and un-equip the bag, avoiding to un-equip all the single items one by one. That way, you can quickly affect encumbrance.
  
The following settings must be set on the item:
1. go to an item under details
2. equipment category: bags
3. wearable: activated

4.1 After that you can drag the items you want to put into the bag into the open window of the bag. Here you can see the pictures of the items in the new tab *Bags*.

4.2 Or you can drag the items directly into the container in the equipment tab of the character sheet. The container must be opened to see the items (4.2.1).

5. Important notes:
5.1. You can only see the tab "Bags" when at least on item is in the bag
5.2. Items inside of bags can not be equipped. You have to take them out of the bag first.
5.3. It's recommended to store items in bags which are not relevant to foundry mechanics but more fluff related (candles, tent, clothing and the like)
